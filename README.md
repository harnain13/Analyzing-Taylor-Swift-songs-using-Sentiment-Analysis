# Analysing Taylor Swift Songs with Emotion Prediction:

### Project Overview:
This project aims to predict the emotional tones of Taylor Swift's songs based on their musical features. Using machine learning techniques, the songs are categorized into emotional categories such as Happy, Sad, Energetic, and Calm. The dataset includes features like danceability, energy, key, loudness, and more extracted from Taylor Swift's songs.

### Conclusion:
Through this project, we successfully developed machine learning models to predict song emotions with reasonable accuracy. The Random Forest Classifier emerged as the top-performing model, achieving an accuracy of 80% in predicting emotional categories. Feature engineering played a crucial role in improving model performance, especially in defining emotional thresholds based on valence and energy.

### Future Work:
Future enhancements could focus on:
- Exploring more sophisticated feature engineering techniques to capture nuanced emotional expressions in songs.
- Incorporating additional datasets to include more albums or artists for broader emotional categorization.
- Implementing deep learning models like neural networks to potentially improve prediction accuracy and generalize across diverse music genres.
